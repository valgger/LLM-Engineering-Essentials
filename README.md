## 🏗️ NPC Factory Project

During the course, you'll build a platform that serves intelligent, believable, reactive, and autonomous NPCs — non-player characters at the heart of immersive games, driving engaging interactions and making worlds feel rich and dynamic.

- Deploy models on real servers and integrate them into game environments.
- Implement agentic capabilities, enabling NPCs to set goals and adapt dynamically.
- Build scalable APIs to support complex game interactions.
- Optimize performance, monitor behavior, and fine-tune models for smooth, responsive gameplay.
